/**
 * Who may do what.

 * Pure and dependency-free, like the rest of lib/*.mjs, so `node` can run the

 *
 * TWO SEPARATE QUESTIONS
 * ----------------------
 *   1. Are you signed in, and to which firm?   -> lib/session.mjs
 *   2. Is your role allowed to do this?        -> here
 *
 * Keeping them apart matters: a signed-in biller is a real user with a valid
 * session who still must not reach the ledger or the danger zone.
 *
 * Permissions are named after what they protect rather than after a page, so a
 * new page that touches invoices inherits the right rule by naming it.
