/**
 * What "clear the transactions" means, in one place.
 *
 * Pure and dependency-free, like the rest of lib/*.mjs, so `node` can run the
 * fixture test directly. Never import Mongoose in here.
 *
 * THE DISTINCTION THAT MATTERS
 * ----------------------------
 * There are two different wipes and they are easy to confuse:
 *
 *   clear everything     - the books AND the masters. Starting from nothing.
 *   clear transactions   - the books only. Customers, items, HSN codes, price
 *                          lists, groups and states all stay. This is what you
 *                          want between a trial run and going live.
 *
 * The second one cannot simply delete and stop. `Customer.lastBal` is a
 * running figure accumulated from the very documents being deleted, so leaving
 * it alone produces a book where parties owe money for invoices that no longer
 * exist -- a ledger showing no rows beside a master saying Rs 50,000 Dr.
 * Every party is reset to its opening balance in the same transaction.
 *
 * Stock needs no equivalent step: it is summed from the stock ledger rows on
 * every read (see lib/itemStock.mjs), so emptying that collection returns every
 * item to its opening quantity by itself. `Item.lastQuantity` is typed in by
 * hand and is not derived from anything, so it is master data and stays.
