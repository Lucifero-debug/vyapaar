/**
 * Wipe the books. Used to reset between demo runs.
 *
 * Guarded by a phrase the caller has to type, because this used to be a bare
 * unauthenticated DELETE: a single stray request -- a crawler, a mistyped
 * curl, anything that found the URL -- destroyed every record with nothing to
 * stop it and no way back.
 *
 * The phrase is not security. It is a speed bump, and the only one available
 * while there is no sign-in. Anything holding real money needs a login in
 * front of this route, not a magic word.
