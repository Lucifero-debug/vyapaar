 * What the next invoice number will probably be — for display on the form.

 * should not burn a number and leave a gap in the book. The number is only
 * really claimed when the invoice is saved, and `save-invoice` re-checks it
 * there, so two people opening the form at once no longer collide.
 *
 * It reads the counter as well as the highest invoice, because a number set by
 * hand on the form can run ahead of the counter.
