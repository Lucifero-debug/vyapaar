/**
 * Retire the index that stops two firms using the same invoice number.
 *
 *   node scripts/sync-indexes.mjs            # report only, changes nothing
 *   node scripts/sync-indexes.mjs --apply    # drop them
 *
 * THE PROBLEM
 *
 * Every unique index on a tenant collection is declared per firm in the
 * schemas -- `{ companyId: 1, invoiceNo: 1 }`. They did not start that way.
 * And **MongoDB does not drop an index because a schema stopped declaring
 * it**: Mongoose's autoIndex creates what is missing and never retires what is
 * obsolete. So the old global `invoiceNo_1` is still there, still unique
 * across every firm, and the second firm to open cannot write invoice 1. Same
 * for a state's name and code, an HSN code, a customer group, the counter.
 *
 * What the user sees is a duplicate-key error about a value they have never
 * used, because somebody in another firm used it.
 *
 * WHAT THIS DOES
 *
 * Drops exactly the unique indexes on tenant collections that are not led by
 * companyId. It does not create anything: Mongoose's autoIndex already builds
 * the per-firm ones when the app boots.
 *
 * Before dropping, it checks each collection for rows that would collide
 * WITHIN one firm. That matters -- if two invoices in the same firm already
 * share a number, the per-firm index cannot build, autoIndex fails quietly at
 * startup, and the collection ends up with no protection at all. Those are
 * reported and the drop is refused unless you pass --force.
 *
 * Index definitions are backed up to /backups first, so a drop can be undone.
